/**
 * A class used to calculate the number of required advertisements in the next
 * operation interval for each ad, such that the ad will meet its delivery
 * requirements.
 *
 * This class is for advertisements in campaigns with a Manual Daily Limit.
 * The required impressions are calculated using the following algorithm:
 *
 * - If the advertisement is in a campaign that has Manual Daily Click and/or Manual Daily
 *   Connection/Conversion Limit, then calculate the campaign's Click Through Ratio and/or
 *   Connection/Conversion Ratio as required, and convert the campaign's remaining
 *   Manual Daily Click and/or Connection/Conversion Limits into an equivalent Manual
 *   Daily Impression Inventory Limit.
 * - Using the smallest of the real or calculated Manual Daily Impression Limit values,
 *   distribute the required impressions between the campaign's advertisements, on the
 *   basis of the campaign's advertisement's weights.
 * - For each advertisement, divide the number of impressions allocated equally between
 *   the available operation intervals remaining in the day. Do not include any operation
 *   intervals where the advertisement has been blocked from delivering (ie. a Day, Time,
 *   or Date Delivery Limitation exists). The number of impressions for each remaining
 *   operation interval will be the number of impressions required for the next operation
 *   interval, unless the advertisement is blocked from delivering in the next operation
 *   interval, in which case the required impressions for the next operation interval will
 *   be zero.
