/**
 * A class used to calculate the number of required advertisements in the next
 * operation interval for each ad, such that the ad will meet its delivery
 * requirements.
 *
 * This class is for advertisements in campaigns with Inventory Requirements and
 * a Campaign Expiration Date. The required impressions are calculated using the
 * following algorithm:
 *
 * - If the advertisement is in a campaign that has Click and/or Connection/Conversion
 *   Inventory Requirements, then calculate the campaign's Click Through Ratio and/or
 *   Connection/Conversion Ratio as required, and convert the campaign's remaining
 *   Click and/or Connection/Conversion Inventory Requirements into an equivalent
 *   Impression Inventory Requirement.
 * - Using the smallest of the real or calculated Impression Inventory Requirement values,
 *   distribute the required impressions between the campaign's advertisements, on the
 *   basis of the campaign's advertisement's weights.
 * - For each advertisement, divide the number of impressions allocated equally between
 *   the available operation intervals remaining in the day(s) before the end of the
 *   campaign. Do not include any operation intervals where the advertisement has been
 *   blocked from delivering (ie. a Day, Time, or Date Delivery Limitation exists). The
 *   number of impressions for each remaining operation interval will be the number of
 *   impressions required for the next operation interval, unless the advertisement is
 *   blocked from delivering in the next operation interval, in which case the required
 *   impressions for the next operation interval will be zero.
